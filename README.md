# FreeBSD Wifibox Port

This repository hosts the development of the FreeBSD port for the
[wifibox project](https://github.com/pgj/freebsd-wifibox) to provide
proper packaging.  Changes here are upstreamed to the FreeBSD ports
tree time to time.

## Installation

Once cloned, the port can be easily installed in the standard way. 

```console

# make install clean
```
